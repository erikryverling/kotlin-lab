/*
    A coroutine is an instance of suspendable computation.
    It's conceptually similar to a thread, in the sense that it
    takes a block of code to run that works concurrently with the
    rest of the code. However, a coroutine is not bound to any particular thread.
    It may suspend its execution in one thread and resume in another one.

    Coroutines can be thought of as light-weight threads, but there is a number of important
    differences that make their real-life usage very different from threads.
